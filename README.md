# deep_learning_final_project

In this project, I built a mul1-task learning model that predicts both house prices with the
regression task, and house category with a classifica1on task, leveraging data explora1on
and manipula1on skills, the PyTorch package, and PyTorch Lightningâ€™s advanced features
such as logging, callback, Trainer API to find the best possible solu1on for the tasks.
